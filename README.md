# Zendesk Frontend boilerplates

A selection of boilerplates for Zendesk Frontend development.

These Vite boilerplates are based entirely on the great work and efforts of [Oleg Gulebsky](https://github.com/OlegGulevskyy/zendesk-vite-boilerplate)
Added so far:

- React + Vite
- Svelte + Vite
- Vue + Vite
- Vanilla JS + Vite

## Getting started

All the custom stacks are under the sample app _ticket_sidebar_

1. Inside the project folder run `npm install`

2. Open two terminals

- terminal one: `npm run ticket_sidebar:start`
- terminal two: `npm run zcli:start`
